Hi there 👋

I am a BCA (AI & Data Science) student at K.R. Mangalam University with a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience across web development, programming, and data analytics.

Skilled in Python, C++, Java, SQL, and Data Structures, with practical exposure to DBMS, Operating Systems, and Software Engineering. I’ve also worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to build clean, user-friendly web interfaces.

📊 Familiar with data analysis and visualization using Power BI and R, along with Machine Learning fundamentals and Artificial Intelligence concepts.
🧠 Strong in problem-solving, logical thinking, and algorithmic basics, continuously improving my DSA skills through practice.
🛠 Comfortable using MS Office tools (Excel, Word, PowerPoint) for data handling, analysis, documentation, and presentations.
🤝 Certified by IBM & Salesforce, and always open to collaborations, mentorship, and opportunities to learn and contribute to real-world projects.

Whether it’s building intuitive applications, analyzing data, or strengthening core CS fundamentals, I enjoy working in growth-focused environments that challenge me to improve every day.
